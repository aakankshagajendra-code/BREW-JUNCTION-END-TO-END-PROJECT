# BREW-JUNCTION-END-TO-END-PROJECT
This project is a Cafe Sales Management and Analytics System built using Python, MySQL, and Power BI. The system allows automated entry of customer orders through a Python-based console application, where data such as shop number, customer name, product details, quantity, pricing, payment mode, and order date are stored in a MySQL database. SQL queries are used to manage, filter, and aggregate data for analysis. The cleaned and structured data is then visualized in Power BI to track key performance indicators such as total sales, orders per shop, product-wise revenue, payment trends, and daily sales patterns. This project showcases practical implementation of SQL for real-world business analytics.
